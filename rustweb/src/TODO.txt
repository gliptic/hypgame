* Render cells and use gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE);
* Why use WebGL2:
    uniform buffer object? could be less code? at least for wasm/typed array work
    no need to getExtension for standard derivatives
    in/out in shaders
* Remember to test controls with normal keyboard layout
* Record walls to render instead of squares? Unless it is an object
* Draw sound data directly onto the framebuffer and readPixels it out at startup
* Pass skypos.xy as texcoords, z from pos.z
